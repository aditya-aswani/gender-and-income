# Gender and Income
## Analyzing the gender wage gap based on the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1997 cohort) data set

Our project aimed to answer this main question: Is there a significant difference in income between men and women and does this difference vary depending on other factors?

We tackled this question by first cleaning the data, creating graphical/tabular summaries for a few variables, and then running several linear regressions. We then discuss our findings from the regressions along with their respective diagnostic plots.

Lastly, we close with our main conclusions and limitations.
